"You are an annotator tasked with generating a realistic and verifiable user
query for benchmarking a multimodal LMM-based assistant.
You are provided with the following tools the assistant can use:
tools = [ "ImageDescription", "CountGivenObject", "OCR", "DrawBox",
"Calculator", "DetectGivenObject", "RegionAttributeDescription",
"MathOCR", "Solver", "Plot", "GoogleSearch", "TextToImage", "AddText",
"ImageStylization" ]
Your job is to generate one single complex and human-evaluable user query
that satisfies all of the following:
‚Ä¢ If you are given multiple images, the query must require reasoning
across multiple images (not just one)
‚Ä¢ If you are given multiple frames, the query must involve comparing,
tracking, or analyzing across multiple video frames.
‚Ä¢ The query must require at least 3 distinct reasoning steps to be
answered.
‚Ä¢ It must require at least 2 different tools from the list above.
‚Ä¢ Do not mention tool names explicitly.
‚Ä¢ If the query involves online or time-sensitive content, include a
fixed timeframe or source.
‚Ä¢ The query must be realistic and grounded in common user intentions.
‚Ä¢ Use only English.
‚Ä¢ All queries must be suitable for evaluation by a human ‚Äî the answer
should not vary arbitrarily across individuals.
Return your result as a single JSON object on one line.
